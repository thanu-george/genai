Step-by-Step Breakdown
1. Get Web Data
What happens
You collect information from a webpage (HTML, images, scripts, text) using:
* Web scraping → getting HTML and parsing it (e.g., BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, Selenium)
* APIs → getting structured JSON/XML from a website’s backend
* Manual download (rarely used in automation)
Why
This is your “raw ingredient.” Without the raw HTML/text, you can’t process anything.

2. Convert into Markdown
What happens
You turn the messy HTML into clean, lightweight Markdown.
For example:
<h1>Title</h1>
<p>Hello world</p>


becomes:
# Title  
Hello world


Why
Markdown is:
* Easier to read
* Easier to store
* Keeps text formatting without extra HTML noise
________________


3. Clean Markdown (if needed)
What happens
Remove unnecessary parts:
* Navigation menus, ads, sidebars
* Extra newlines or spaces
* Links or images you don’t need
Example in Python:
text = markdown_text.replace("\n\n\n", "\n\n")


Why
Cleaner text = better quality later when embedding and searching.

4. Chunk Markdown Data
What happens
You break large text into smaller, meaningful chunks (e.g., 200–500 words each).
* If you don’t chunk, large documents may:
   * Overflow embedding size limits
   * Lose precision in search
Example:
chunks = [text[i:i+500] for i in range(0, len(text), 500)]


Why
Search engines (or vector databases) work best when each stored item is small and focused.

5. Embed Data
What happens
You convert text chunks into vector embeddings — numerical representations of meaning — using a model like:
* OpenAI’s text-embedding-3-small
* Sentence Transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
Example:
embedding = model.embed(chunk)


Why
This allows semantic search → finding results by meaning, not exact words.

6. Prepare Schema in Vector Database
What happens
You design how data will be stored in the database:
* Fields: id, content, embedding, metadata
* Index type: e.g., cosine similarity, HNSW graph
Why
A schema is the “blueprint” — without it, you can’t store or retrieve efficiently.
________________


7. Prepare Metadata
What happens
Attach descriptive info for each chunk:
{
  "id": "page-1-chunk-3",
  "source": "https://example.com",
  "section": "Introduction",
  "date_scraped": "2025-08-12"
}


Why
Metadata helps with filtering search results later (e.g., “only from 2023” or “only blog posts”).
________________


8. Store Metadata and Embedded Data
What happens
* Send the embedding to the vector database
* Send the metadata alongside
* Store them in a way that allows fast similarity search
Popular vector DBs:
* Pinecone
* Weaviate
* Milvus
* FAISS (local)
Why
Now you have a searchable “knowledge base” where you can ask:
“Find me all paragraphs about renewable energy policy”
…and it’ll find them by meaning, not keywords.

The Big Picture
This is essentially ETL for unstructured web text:
1. Extract → Scrape or fetch the data
2. Transform → Clean, chunk, and embed it
3. Load → Store in a vector database with metadata
