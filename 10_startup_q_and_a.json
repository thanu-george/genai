        "Predicted answer":"The context does not provide enough information about what seed funding refers to.

Each VC fund has its investment thesis � preferred sectors, stage of the startup, and funding amount � which should align with your startup. VCs take startup equity in return for their investments and actively engage in the mentorship of their investee startups.\n### Banks/Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs)\nFormal debt can be raised from banks and NBFCs at this stage as the startup can show market traction and revenue to validate its ability to finance interest payment obligations. This is especially applicable for working capital. Some entrepreneurs might prefer debt over equity as debt funding does not dilute equity stake.\n### Venture Debt Funds\nVenture Debt funds are private investment funds that invest money in startups primarily in the form of debt.
