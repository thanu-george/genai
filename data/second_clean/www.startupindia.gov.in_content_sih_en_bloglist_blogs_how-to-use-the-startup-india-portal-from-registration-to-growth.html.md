Over the last decade, India has redefined its position in the global innovation landscape as a talent hub and builder of scalable, high-impact enterprises. Today, the country boasts one of the world’s most dynamic startup ecosystems, with over 1.74 lakh certificates issued1 for startup recognition spanning across sectors from DeepTech and AgriTech to SpaceTech and health innovation. Launched as part of the Startup India initiative, the portal was designed to democratise access to India’s entrepreneurial infrastructure, bringing together regulatory support, funding avenues, learning resources and growth opportunities onto a single digital platform.
For early-stage founders and small teams in non-metro regions, for entrepreneurs navigating compliance for the first time, the Startup India portal serves as a powerful catalyst if used strategically for growth and expansion. Ahead is a detailed guide on how a startup can register on the Startup India portal, moving from recognition to readiness and ultimately to scalable growth. Let’s begin.
### **Register on the Startup India Portal**
The first interaction with the Startup India portal begins with a simple yet crucial step: registration. This step marks the beginning of your startup’s journey into a broader, government-backed support ecosystem. It establishes your legitimacy within the startup ecosystem and enables you to explore and apply for a range of government-led programs, initiatives and resources.
All you need to do is follow the steps mentioned below:
* Visit [**Startup India portal**](http://www.startupindia.gov.in)
* Click on “Register”, it will redirect to the Bhaskar portal where you need to complete the form with details, such as first name, last name, email ID, nationality and get your Bhaskar ID generated.
* Log in to the Startup India Portal, fill in your details and submit.
* Set up a password and verify your registration via an OTP.
* Log in to your newly created dashboard.
Registration on the Startup India portal ensures you can begin utilising the platform to apply for recognition, access to incubator networks, apply for funding schemes, like the Startup India Seed Fund Scheme, Investor Connect and much more.
*Disclaimer: The numbers mentioned consist of all certificates issued till 30th April 2025, including approved, cancelled, and expired startup*
### **Become a DPIIT Recognised Startup**
After registering, the next step is to secure recognition from the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT). This step opens up various opportunities, like tax exemptions, funding avenues and compliance advantages for your startup. The strategic benefits of DPIIT recognition include:
* Self-certification compliance under labour and environmental laws for up to 5 years, reducing the regulatory burden.
* Faster patent examination and IPR support, including up to 80% rebate on patent filing fees.
* Three-year income tax exemption under Section 80-IAC, easing early-stage financial pressure.
* Relaxed norms in public procurement, such as exemption from prior experience, turnover and earnest money deposit when bidding for government tenders.
Here is how you can apply for recognition:
* From your portal dashboard, navigate to the “Get Recognised” section.
* Fill out the application form, detailing your startup’s uniqueness and innovation.
* Upload the necessary documents and a brief description of your business model.
* Submit the form for review.
### **Access to Funding Schemes**
Once recognised, a startup becomes eligible for several government-backed funding schemes to drive innovation and scalability. DPIIT recognised startups can access the following funding avenues listed on the Startup India portal:
* **[Startup India Seed Fund Scheme (SISFS)](https://seedfund.startupindia.gov.in/):** Provides financial support to early-stage startups for proof of concept, prototype development and market entry.
* **[Fund of Funds for Startups (FFS)](https://www.sidbivcf.in/en/funds/ffs):** Managed by SIDBI, this scheme boosts the availability of domestic capital by providing funding support to SEBI-registered venture capital firms, which in turn invest in eligible startups.
* **[Credit Guarantee Scheme for Startups (CGSS)](https://www.startupindia.gov.in/content/sih/en/credit-guarantee-scheme-for-startups.html):** Offers collateral-free debt funding backed by a government guarantee to ease access to credit.
### **Access to Learning and Development Tools**
Startups and aspiring entrepreneurs who wish to build their knowledge and strengthen their business capabilities can navigate to the portal’s curated learning modules and toolkits section. These include well-researched courses on fundraising, legal compliance, marketing strategies and product development. The Startup India portal also provides access to ready-to-use templates for essential business documents, such as shareholder agreements, term sheets and pitch decks. Furthermore, regular webinars, masterclasses and workshops hosted by domain experts offer startups real-time guidance and actionable insights.
### **Stay Compliant and Informed**
Compliance is integral to running a business, and the Startup India portal eases this burden through its self-certification mechanism. DPIIT recognised startups can comply with labour and environmental laws through a simplified process without routine inspections for up to five years. The portal also offers tracking tools for application statuses, updates on policy changes or reach out for grievance redressal. These resources ensure that startups remain aligned with government norms while focusing on core business operations.
In conclusion, more than a digital repository, the Startup India portal is a comprehensive, end-to-end platform designed to support startup growth across all dimensions. From regulatory recognition to funding opportunities, capacity building and market entry support, the portal consolidates the vast landscape of startup resources into one accessible space. For founders looking to build resilient, scalable ventures, make the most of the Startup India portal by becoming a DPIIT recognised startup.
