 # Overview
Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) are emerging as a strategic business tool for any business organisation to enhance industrial competitiveness. Startups, with limited resources and manpower, can sustain themselves in this highly competitive world only through continuous growth and development\-orientated innovations; for this, it is equally crucial that they protect their IPRs in India and outside. The scheme for Startups Intellectual Property Protection (SIPP) is envisaged to facilitate the protection of Patents, Trademarks and Designs of innovative and interested Startups in India and outside.
