Incubator Schemes

### **Incubators play a vital role in the growth of startups. They provide the necessary resources, such as infrastructure, mentorship, and financial support, to nurture and support the innovation of startups. India has 400+ incubators, with most of them at a nascent stage. Startup India aims to enhance the capacities of the existing incubators and also provide support in setting up new incubators.**
