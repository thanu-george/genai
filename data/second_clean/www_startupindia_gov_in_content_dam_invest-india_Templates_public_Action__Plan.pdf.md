Section 1 \- IntroductionStartup India: Action Plan
“I see startups,
technology
and innovation as
exciting and effective
instruments for
India’s transformation.”
Shri Narendra Modi
Prime Minister of India
Startup India
is a flagship initiative of the Government of India, intended to build a
strong eco\-system for nurturing innovation and Startups in the country that will drive sustainable
economic growth and generate large scale employment opportunities. The Government through
this initiative aims to empower Startups to grow through innovation and design.
In order to meet the objectives of the initiative, Government of India is announcing this Action Plan
that addresses all aspects of the Startup ecosystem. With this Action Plan the Government
hopes to accelerate spreading of the Startup movement:
• From digital/ technology sector to a wide array of sectors including agriculture,
manufacturing, social sector, healthcare, education, etc.; and
• From existing tier 1 cities to tier 2 and tier 3 citites including semi\-urban and rural areas.
The Action Plan is divided across the following areas:
• Simplification and Handholding
• Funding Support and Incentives
• Industry\-Academia Partnership and Incubation
The definition of a Startup (only for the purpose of Government schemes) has been detailed in
Annexure I.

Compliance Regime based on Self\-Certification
Objective
To reduce the regulatory burden on Startups thereby allowing them to focus on their core business
and keep compliance cost low
Details
Regulatory formalities requiring compliance with various labour and environment laws are time
consuming and difficult in nature. Often, new and small firms are unaware of nuances of the issues and
can be subjected to intrusive action by regulatory agencies. In order to make compliance for Startups
friendly and flexible, simplifications are required in the regulatory regime.
Accordingly, the process of conducting inspections shall be made more meaningful and simple.
Startups shall be allowed to self\-certify compliance (through the Startup mobile app) with 9 labour
and environment laws (refer below). In case of the labour laws, no inspections will be conducted for a
period of 3 years. Startups may be inspected on receipt of credible and verifiable complaint of
violation, filed in writing and approved by at least one level senior to the inspecting officer.
In case of environment laws, Startups which fall under the ‘white category’ (as defined by the Central
Pollution Control Board (CPCB)) would be able to self\-certify compliance and only random checks
would be carried out in such cases.
Labour Laws:
• The Building and Other Constructions Workers’ (Regulation of Employment \& Conditions of
Service) Act, 1996
• The Inter\-State Migrant Workmen (Regulation of Employment \& Conditions of Service) Act, 1979
• The Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972
• The Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970
• The Employees’ Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952
• The Employees’ State Insurance Act, 1948
Environment Laws:
• The Water (Prevention \& Control of Pollution) Act, 1974
• The Water (Prevention \& Control of Pollution) Cess (Amendment) Act, 2003
• The Air (Prevention \& Control of Pollution) Act, 1981

Startup India Hub
Objective
To create a single point of contact for the entire Startup ecosystem and enable knowledge exchange
and access to funding
Details
Young Indians today have the conviction to venture out on their own and a conducive ecosystem lets
them watch their ideas come to life. In today’s environment we have more Startups and entrepreneurs
than ever before and the movement is at the cusp of a revolution. However, many Startups do not
reac h their full potential due to limited guidance and access.
The Government of India has taken various measures to improve the ease of doing business and is
also building an exciting and enabling environment for these Startups, with the launch of the “Startup
India” movement.
The “Startup India Hub” will be a key stakeholder in this vibrant ecosystem and will:
• Work in a hub and spoke model and collaborate with Central \& State governments, Indian and
foreign VCs, angel networks, banks, incubators, legal partners, consultants, universities and R\&D
institutions
• Assist Startups through their lifecycle with specific focus on important aspects like obtaining
financing, feasibility testing, business structuring advisory, enhancement of marketing skills,
technology commercialization and management evaluation
• Organize mentorship programs in collaboration with government organizations, incubation
centers, educational institutions and private organizations who aspire to foster innovation.
To all young Indians who have the courage to enter an environment of risk, the Startup India Hub will be
their friend, mentor and guide to hold their hand and walk with them through this journey.
7Startup India: Action Plan
3
Rolling\-out of Mobile App and Portal
Objective
To serve as the single platform for Startups for interacting with Government and Regulatory
Institutions for all business needs and information exchange among various stakeholders
Details
In order to commence operations, Startups require registration with relevant regulatory authorities.
Delays or lack of clarity in registration process may lead to delays in establishment and operations of
Startups, thereby reducing the ability of the business to get bank loans, employ workers and generate
incomes. Enabling registration process in an easy and timely manner can reduce this burden
significantly.
Besides, Startups often suffer from the uncertainty regarding the exact regulatory requirements to
set up its operations. In order to ensure that such information is readily available, it is intended that a
checklist of required licenses covering labour licensing, environmental clearances etc. be made
available. Currently, the Startup ecosystem in India also lacks formal platform(s) for Startups to
connect and collaborate with other ecosystem partners.
Towards these efforts, the Government shall introduce a Mobile App to provide on\-the\-go accessibility for:
• Registering Startups with relevant agencies of the Government. A simple form shall be made
available for the same. The Mobile App shall have backend integration with Ministry of Corporate
Affairs and Registrar of Firms for seamless information exchange and processing of the
registration application
• Tracking the status of the registration application and anytime downloading of the registration
certificate. A digital version of the final registration certificate shall be made available for
downloading through the Mobile App
• Filing for compliances and obtaining information on various clearances/ approvals/ registrations
required
• Collaborating with various Startup ecosystem partners. The App shall provide a collaborative
platform with a national network of stakeholders (including venture funds, incubators, academia,
mentors etc.) of the Startup ecosystem to have discussions towards enhancing and bolstering the
ecosystem
• Applying for various schemes being undertaken under the Startup India Action Plan
The App shall be made available from April 01, 2016 on all leading mobile/ smart devices’
platforms. The Startup portal shall have similar functionalities (being offered through the mobile
app) using a richer web\-based User Interface.

4 Legal Support and Fast\-tracking Patent Examination at
Lower Costs
Objective
To promote awareness and adoption of IPRs by Startups and facilitate them in protecting and
commercializing the IPRs by providing access to high quality Intellectual Property services and
resources, including fast\-track examination of patent applications and rebate in fees.
Details
Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) are emerging as a strategic business tool for any business
organization to enhance industrial competitiveness. Startups with limited resources and manpower,
can sustain in this highly competitive world only through continuous growth and development oriented
innovations; for this, it is equally crucial that they protect their IPRs. The scheme for Startup Intellectual
Property Protection (SIPP) shall facilitate filing of Patents, Trademarks and Designs by innovative
Startups. Various measures being taken in this regard include:
• Fast\-tracking of Startup patent applications: The valuation of any innovation goes up immensely,
once it gets the protective cover of a patent. To this end, the patent application of Startups shall be
fast\-tracked for examination and disposal, so that they can realize the value of their IPRs at the
earliest possible.
• Panel of facilitators to assist in filing of IP applications: For effective implementation of the scheme,
a panel of “facilitators” shall be empanelled by the Controller General of Patents, Designs and
Trademarks (CGPDTM), who shall also regulate their conduct and functions. Facilitators will be
responsible for providing general advisory on different IPRs as also information on protecting and
promoting IPRs in other countries. They shall also provide assistance in filing and disposal of the IP
applications related to patents, trademarks and designs under relevant Acts, including appearing on
behalf of Startups at hearings and contesting opposition, if any, by other parties, till final disposal of
the IPR application.
• Government to bear facilitation cost: Under this scheme, the Central Government shall bear the
entire fees of the facilitators for any number of patents, trademarks or designs that a Startup may
file, and the Startups shall bear the cost of only the statutory fees payable.
• Rebate on filing of application: Startups shall be provided an 80% rebate in filing of patents vis\-a\-vis
other companies. This will help them pare costs in the crucial formative years.
The scheme is being launched initially on a pilot basis for 1 year; based on the experience gained,
further steps shall be taken.

Relaxed Norms of Public Procurement for Startups
Objective
To provide an equal platform to Startups (in the manufacturing sector) vis\-à\-vis the experienced
entrepreneurs/ companies in public procurement
Details
Typically, whenever a tender is floated by a Government entity or by a PSU, very often the eligibility
condition specifies either “prior experience” or “prior turnover”. Such a stipulation prohibits/ impedes
Startups from participating in such tenders.
At present, effective April 1, 2015 Central Government, State Government and PSUs have to
mandatorily procure at least 20% from the Micro Small and Medium Enterprise (MSME).
In order to promote Startups, Government shall exempt Startups (in the manufacturing sector) from
the criteria of “prior experience/ turnover” without any relaxation in quality standards or technical
parameters. The Startups will also have to demonstrate requisite capability to execute the project as
per the requirements and should have their own manufacturing facility in India.
10Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion
6
Faster Exit for Startups
Objective
To make it easier for Startups to wind up operations
Details
Given the innovative nature of Startups, a significant percentage fail to succeed. In the event of a
business failure, it is critical to reallocate capital and resources to more productive avenues and
accordingly a swift and simple process has been proposed for Startups to wind\-up operations. This
will promote entrepreneurs to experiment with new and innovative ideas, without having the fear of
facing a complex and long\-drawn exit process where their capital remain interminably stuck.
The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Bill 2015 (“IBB”), tabled in the Lok Sabha in December 2015 has
provisions for the fast track and / or voluntary closure of businesses.
In terms of the IBB, Startups with simple debt structures or those meeting such criteria as may be
specified may be wound up within a period of 90 days from making of an application for winding up on
a fast track basis. In such instances, an insolvency professional shall be appointed for the Startup, who
shall be in charge of the company (the promoters and management shall no longer run the company)
for liquidating its assets and paying its creditors within six months of such appointment. On
appointment of the insolvency professional, the liquidator shall be responsible for the swift closure of
the business, sale of assets and repayment of creditors in accordance with the distribution waterfall
set out in the IBB. This process will respect the concept of limited liability.

Section 2\.2: Funding Support
and IncentivesDepartment of Industrial Policy and Promotion
Providing Funding Support through a Fund of Funds with a
7
Corpus of INR 10,000 crore
Objective
To provide funding support for development and growth of innovation driven enterprises
Details
One of key challenges faced by Startups in India has been access to finance. Often Startups, due to
lack of collaterals or existing cash flows, fail to justify the loans. Besides, the high risk nature of
Startups wherein a significant percentage fail to take\-off, hampers their investment attractiveness.
In order to provide funding support to Startups, Government will set up a fund with an initial corpus of
INR 2,500 crore and a total corpus of INR 10,000 crore over a period 4 years (i.e. INR 2,500 crore per
year) . The Fund will be in the nature of Fund of Funds, which means that it will not invest directly into
Startups, but shall participate in the capital of SEBI registered Venture Funds.
Key features of the Fund of Funds are highlighted below:
• The Fund of Funds shall be managed by a Board with private professionals drawn from industry
bodies, academia, and successful Startups
• Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) shall be a co\-investor in the Fund of Funds
• The Fund of Funds shall contribute to a maximum of 50% of the stated daughter fund size. In order
to be able to receive the contribution, the daughter fund should have already raised the balance
50% or more of the stated fund size as the case maybe. The Fund of Funds shall have
representation on the governance structure/ board of the venture fund based on the contribution
made.
• The Fund shall ensure support to a broad mix of sectors such as manufacturing, agriculture, health,
education, etc.

Credit Guarantee Fund for Startups
Objective
To catalyse enterpreneurship by providing credit to innovators accross all sections of society
Details
In order to overcome traditional Indian stigma associated with failure of Startup enterprises in general
and to encourage experimentation among Startup entrepreneurs through disruptive business models,
credit guarantee comfort would help flow of Venture Debt from the formal Banking System.
Debt funding to Startups is also perceived as high risk area and to encourage Banks and other Lenders
to provide Venture Debts to Startups, Credit guarantee mechanism through National Credit
Guarantee Trust Company (NCGTC)/ SIDBI is being envisaged with a budgetary Corpus of INR 500
crore per year for the next four years.
14Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion

Tax Exemption on Capital Gains
Objective
To promote investments into Startups by mobilizing the capital gains arising from sale of capital assets
Details
Due to their high risk nature, Startups are not able to attract investment in their initial stage. It is
therefore important that suitable incentives are provided to investors for investing in the Startup
ecosystem. With this objective, exemption shall be given to persons who have capital gains during the
year, if they have invested such capital gains in the Fund of Funds recognized by the Government.
This will augment the funds available to various VCs/AIFs for investment in Startups.
In addition, existing capital gain tax exemption for investment in newly formed manufacturing MSMEs
by individuals shall be extended to all Startups. Currently, such an entity needs to purchase “new
assests” with the capital gain received to avail such an exemption. Investment in ‘computer or
computer software’ (as used in core business activity) shall also be considered as purchase of ‘new
assets’ in order to promote technology driven Startups.
15Startup India: Action Plan
10
Tax Exemption to Startups for 3 years
Objective
To promote the growth of Startups and address working capital requirements
Details
Innovation is the essence of every Startup. Young minds kindle new ideas every day to think beyond
conventional strategies of the existing corporate world.
During the initial years, budding entrepreneurs struggle to evaluate the feasibility of their business idea.
Significant capital investment is made in embracing ever\-changing technology, fighting rising
competition and navigating through the unique challenges arising from their venture. Also, there are
limited alternative sources of finance available to the small and growing entrepreneurs, leading to
constrained cash funds.
With a view to stimulate the development of Startups in India and provide them a competitive
platform, it is imperative that the profits of Startup initiatives are exempted from income\-tax for a
period of 3 years. This fiscal exemption shall facilitate growth of business and meet the working capital
requirements during the initial years of operations. The exemption shall be available subject to
non\-distribution of dividend by the Startup.
16Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion
11
Tax Exemption on Investments above Fair Market Value
Objective
To encourage seed\-capital investment in Startups
Details
Under The Income Tax Act, 1961, where a Startup (company) receives any consideration for issue of
shares which exceeds the Fair Market Value (FMV) of such shares, such excess consideration is taxable
in the hands of recipient as Income from Other Sources.
In the context of Startups, where the idea is at a conceptualization or development stage, it is often
difficult to determine the FMV of such shares. In majority of the cases, FMV is also significantly lower
than the value at which the capital investment is made. This results into the tax being levied under
section 56(2\) (viib).
Currently, investment by venture capital funds in Startups is exempted from operations of this
provision. The same shall be extended to investment made by incubators in the Startups.

Section 2\.3: Industry\-Academia
Partnership and IncubationDepartment of Industrial Policy and Promotion
12 Organizing Startup Fests for Showcasing Innovation and
Providing a Collaboration Platform
Objective
To galvanize the Startup ecosystem and to provide national and international visibility to the Startup
ecosystem in India
Details
A pivotal component for growth of Startups is regular communication and collaboration within the
Startup community, both national as well international. An effective Startup ecosystem can’t be
created by the Startups alone. It is dependent on active participation of academia, investors, industry
and other stakeholders.
To bolster the Startup ecosystem in India, the Government is proposing to introduce Startup fests at
national and international stages.
These fests would provide a platform to Startups in India to showcase their ideas and work with a
larger audience comprising of potential investors, mentors and fellow Startups.
As part of “Make in India” initiative, Government proposes to:
• Hold one fest at the national level annually to enable all the stakeholders of Startup ecosystem to
come together on one platform.
• Hold one fest at the international level annually in an international city known for its Startup
ecosystem.
The fests shall have activities such as sessions to connect with investors, mentors, incubators and
Startups, showcasing innovations, exhibitions and product launches, pitches by Startups, mentoring
sessions, curated Startup walks, talks by disruptive innovators, competitions such as Hackathon,
Makerspace, etc., announcements of rewards and recognitions, panels and conferences with industry
leaders, etc.

13 Launch of Atal Innovation Mission (AIM) with Self\-Employment
and Talent Utilization (SETU) Program
Objective
To serve as a platform for promotion of world\-class Innovation Hubs, Grand Challenges, Startup
businesses and other self\-employment activities, particularly in technology driven areas
Details
The Atal Innovation Mission (AIM) shall have two core functions:
• Entrepreneurship promotion through Self\-Employment and Talent Utilization (SETU), wherein
innovators would be supported and mentored to become successful entrepreneurs

Harnessing Private Sector Expertise for Incubator Setup
Objective
To ensure professional management of Government sponsored / funded incubators,
Government will create a policy and framework for setting\-up of incubators across the country in
public private partnership
Details
India currently lacks availability of incubation facilities across various parts of the country. Incubation
facilities typically include physical infrastructure, provision of mentorship support, access to
networks, access to market, etc. Of all these features, physical infrastructure entails large capital
investments which can generally be facilitated by the Government. However, requisite skills for
operating an incubator are pivotal as well, for which expertise of the private sector needs to be
leveraged. Considering this, Government shall encourage setting up of;
• 35 new incubators in existing institutions. Funding support of 40% (subject to a maximum of INR 10
crore) shall be provided by Central Government for establishment of new incubators for which 40%
funding by the respective State Government and 20% funding by the private sector has been
committed. The incubator shall be managed and operated by the private sector.
• 35 new private sector incubators. A grant of 50% (subject to a maximum of INR 10 crore) shall be
provided by Central Government for incubators established by private sector in existing institutions.
The incubator shall be managed and operated by the private sector.
The funding for setting up of the incubators shall be provided by NITI Aayog as part of Atal Innovation
Mission (refer \#13 of this Action Plan). Participating departments and agencies for setting up of new
incubators shall be Department of Science and Technology, Department of Biotechnology,
Department of Electronics and Information Technology, Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium
Enterprises, Department of Higher Education, Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion and
NITI Aayog.
Each of the above mentioned departments/agencies would enter into a standard MoU with identified
private sector players for creation of academia\-industry tie\-ups for nurturing innovations in
academic institutions.

Details
In order to augment the incubation and R\&D efforts in the country, the Government will set up/ scale up
31 centres (to provide facilities for over 1,200 new Startups) of innovation and entrepreneurship at
national institutes, including:
• Setting\-up 13 Startup centres: Annual funding support of INR 50 lakhs (shared 50:50 by DST
and MHRD) shall be provided for three years for encouraging student driven Startups from the
host institute.
• Setting\-up/ Scaling\-up 18 Technology Business Incubators (TBIs) at NITs/IITs/IIMs etc. as per

Annual Incubator Grand Challenge
Objective
To support creation of successful world class incubators in India
Details
For a new idea to become a successful commercial venture, adequate support and mentoring at
various stages of the business lifecycle is required. Incubators play an important role in identifying early
stage Startups and supporting them across various phases of their lifecycle. In order to build an
effective Startup ecosystem, it is imperative that world class incubators, adopting leading industry
practices, are setup in the country.
The Government is proposing to make forward looking investments towards building world class
incubators. In its first phase, the aim is to establish 10 such incubators. To enable this, GoI shall identify
and select 10 incubators who have the potential to become world class. These incubators would be
given INR 10 crore each as financial assistance which may be used for ramping up the quality of service
offerings. The incubators shall also become reference models for other incubators aspiring to offer
best\-in\-class services. Video interviews of these incubators would be showcased on the Startup India
portal.
An “Incubator Grand Challenge” exercise shall be carried out for identification of these incubators. The
exercise shall entail:
• Open invitation of applications from incubators
• Screening and evaluation based on pre\-defined Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The Incubator Grand Challenge shall be an annual exercise.

Annexure I: Definition of a Startup
(only for the purpose of
Government schemes)Startup India: Action Plan
Part A: Definition of Startup (only for the purpose of Government schemes)
