A State’s Startup Policy is critical in providing the essential funding, mentorship, and market access support required by startups to grow as important contributors to the State’s economy in terms of revenue and job creation. Additionally, it also contains provisions to incentivise key startup stakeholders such as incubators, and institutions of higher education among others so as to promote holistic development for India’s startup ecosystem. The Startup India team provides active support to States in formulation and operationalisation of their startup policies.
