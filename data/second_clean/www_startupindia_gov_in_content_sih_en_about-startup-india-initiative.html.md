# About Startup India
Startup India is a flagship initiative of the Government of India, intended to catalyse startup culture and build a strong and inclusive ecosystem for innovation and entrepreneurship in India.
## What is the Startup India Initiative?
Launched on 16th January, 2016, the Startup India Initiative has rolled out several programs with the objective of supporting entrepreneurs, building a robust startup ecosystem and transforming India into a country of job creators instead of job seekers. These programs are managed by a dedicated Startup India Team, which reports to The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT)
The broad scope of Startup India’s programs is outlined in the Action Plan below.
