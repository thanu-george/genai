DPIIT recognition serves as a formal endorsement of a startup’s innovation, scalability and potential to contribute to India’s entrepreneurial ecosystem. It marks a pivotal moment that validates the business model, strengthens market credibility and opens the door to a wide range of institutional and policy-level support. However, this milestone is not an end in itself. It marks the beginning of a critical phase where early-stage decisions carry long-term implications. The first 100 days following recognition are instrumental in shaping the trajectory of the enterprise. This period calls for a clear roadmap focusing on leveraging available incentives, building strategic partnerships and establishing strong operational foundations to drive sustainable growth.
Startups utilising this phase effectively are positioned to scale, attract investment and integrate into national and global value chains. The following roadmap outlines key steps startup founders must consider during the initial 100-day window to maximise the benefits of DPIIT recognition and establish a strong foundation for sustained growth.
### **Study the Benefits and Align Them with Your Business Plan**
DPIIT recognised startups are eligible for a broad set of benefits, including exemptions, regulatory relaxations and funding support. The first step is to review these incentives thoroughly and identify which ones to apply to your startup’s current stage.
**Key incentives include:**
* Income tax deduction under Section 80-IAC (subject to the grant of the Certificate of Eligible Business by the Inter-Ministerial Board).
* Exemption from Angel Tax under Section 56(2)(viib).
* Self-certification compliance under select labour and environmental laws.
* Fast-track processing of patent and trademark applications.
* Access to public procurement through the Government e-Marketplace (GeM)
Startup founders can map these benefits against their business objectives and timelines. They must also comply with necessary documentation and eligibility requirements from the outset.
### **Prepare for Funding Opportunities**
DPIIT recognition enhances investor confidence and eligibility for various government-backed funding schemes. Startups are invited to apply for the Startup India Seed Fund Scheme (SISFS) and other state-level funding initiatives that prioritise recognised entities.
**In the first 100 days, startups must:**
* Strengthen their financial documentation, pitch deck and future projections.
* Clearly define the funding requirement and proposed utilisation.
* Identify incubators, angel networks and venture capital firms aligned with your sector.
The goal is to position your startup as an investment-ready venture that is compliant with funding protocols. Early engagement with financial advisors or mentors is recommended.
### **Engage Actively with Incubators and Startup Hubs**
DPIIT recognised startups receive preference from several incubators and accelerators across the country. These platforms offer access to infrastructure, legal and business advisory services, investor networks and market exposure.
**During this phase, startups may:**
* Register on the Startup India Hub and complete their profile.
* Explore partnerships with incubators or accelerators that provide sector-specific guidance.
* Participate in webinars, pitch sessions and networking events hosted by Startup India or its partners.
* Register on BHASKAR to gain visibility and connect with relevant stakeholders across the ecosystem.
### **Establish Internal Systems and Regulatory Frameworks**
Recognition is an opportunity to formalise internal systems that support growth and compliance. Founders must use the first 100-day window to strengthen corporate governance, financial tracking and legal readiness, as it builds investor confidence and supports long-term scalability.
**The focus areas must include:**
* Implementing standard accounting and auditing standards.
* Setting up a clear cap table and shareholder agreements.
* Streamlining HR practices, contracts and NDAs.
* Ensuring the timely filing of statutory obligations.
### **Leverage Intellectual Property (IP) Support**
Startups can access fast-track examinations and get up to an 80% rebate on patent filing fees, along with trademark support. Intellectual property enhances competitiveness and strengthens your positioning in Indian and global markets.
**Startup founders may begin with:**
* Identifying core innovations, product features or brand elements worth protecting.
* Consulting an IP expert to assess filing requirements.
* Initiating applications early to safeguard your assets.
### **Increase Visibility Through Public Procurement and Market Access**
DPIIT recognised startups have the opportunity to list their products and services on the Government e-Marketplace (GeM), bypassing prior turnover and experience requirements. This creates a direct channel to sell to government departments and PSUs.
**Next steps include:**
* Registering as a seller on GeM.
* Aligning offerings to sector-specific procurement needs.
* Ensuring quality, delivery and pricing standards are in place.
DPIIT recognition represents a vote of confidence from the Indian government in your startup’s potential. The first 100 days after recognition are critical to translating that confidence into structured growth. By proactively utilising available benefits, strengthening internal capabilities and engaging with the broader startup ecosystem, you lay the groundwork for long-term impact.
Startup India remains committed to supporting founders at every stage of their journey. As you begin this new chapter, remember that the ecosystem, resources and networks you need are now within your reach. The momentum you build today will shape the future you create tomorrow.
