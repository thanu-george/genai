### SCO Special Working Group on Startups and Innovation

All Member States agreed to create a Special Working Group for Startups and Innovation (SWG) at the Summit of SCO Heads of State in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, on 16th September 2022\. Given the importance of innovation and entrepreneurship in driving and diversifying an economy, India proposed this initiative in 2020 to create a new pillar of cooperation between the SCO Member States. The SWG was created with the vision of fostering collaboration among SCO Member States, to not only benefit the startup ecosystem but also accelerate regional economic development. After multiple rounds of meetings chaired by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), Government of India, the Member States decided to approve and adopt the Regulations of the SWG to be permanently chaired by India in SCO. 

DPIIT has organised various initiatives for the startup ecosystems of the SCO Member States since 2020, including three editions of the SCO Startup Forum. By leading such engagements, India undertook an opportunity to expand the innovation footprint, knitting the whole ecosystem together and inspiring other SCO Member States to take up similar programs. 

### SCO Startup Forum

The SCO Startup Forum is a platform for the stakeholders from the startup ecosystems from all SCO Member States to interact and collaborate. The entrepreneurial activities aim to empower the local startup communities in the SCO Member States. The SCO Startup Forum aims to create multilateral cooperation and engagement for startups among the SCO Member States. This engagement will empower the local startup ecosystems in the SCO Member States.

The following are the objectives of the engagement:  

* Sharing of best practices to promote entrepreneurship and innovation to build knowledge\-exchange systems
* Bringing Corporates and Investors across to work closely with startups and provide local entrepreneurs with much\-needed support and market access
* Increasing scaling opportunities for startups by providing solutions in the field of social innovation and provide the Governments with a plethora of innovative solutions
* Creating open procurement channels to enable matchmaking for procuring innovative solutions from startups
* Facilitating cross\-border incubation and acceleration programs that will enable the startups to explore international markets and get focused mentorship.

### SCO Startup Forum 3\.0

DPIIT organised the SCO Startup Forum 3\.0 on 11th April 2023 in New Delhi, India. The forum saw physical participation from the SCO Member States. Shri Som Parkash, Hon’ble Minister of State for Commerce and Industry, delivered the keynote address, highlighting the role of the Startup Ecosystem in the development of a nation and past initiatives such as Startup Forum 2020, Startup Forum 2021, and SCO Mentorship Series for SCO Member States. Smt. Manmeet Kaur Nanda, Joint Secretary, Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade, Ministry of Commerce \& Industry, addressed the delegation about India’s Startup Journey and various initiatives undertaken by DPIIT to help startups scale up.

 Activities in SCO Startup Forum 2\.O

* Open Innovation Challenge
-------------------------

To encourage global corporations and investors to work closely with startups and provide local entrepreneurs with much\-needed support and market access, structured models of engagement with corporations and investors are critical. Forum 2021 launches the Open Innovation Challenge in partnership with foundations, corporations, and investors to recognise and reward sector\-agnostic startups. This Open Innovation Challenge enables the identification of solutions that can be implemented in the SCO Member States. These Corporates, Foundations, and Investors will provide incentives such as cash grants, pilot projects, incubators, mentorship, co\-development opportunity among others to the winning startups from all SCO Member States. [Open Innovation Challenge](https://www.startupindia.gov.in/content/sih/en/ams-application/challenge.html?applicationId=61715de2e4b0324c10f30efb)
* Multilateral Incubator Program
------------------------------

To facilitate cross\-border incubation and acceleration that enable startups to explore international markets and get focused mentorship, deliberating over Multilateral Incubator Programs is a must. In Forum 2021, a session focusing on the Multilateral Incubator Program has been organised with the aim of sharing the nuances of setting up an incubation centre to help startups scale up their ideas. This session focuses on how the Government bodies can support incubators through fiscal and non\-fiscal incentives. Further, a 30\-minute virtual tour will be conducted by an Indian Incubator, focusing on the building blocks of setting up an incubator and the different elements of an incubation centre for the relevant stakeholders of the SCO Member States.
* Knowledge Sharing Workshops
---------------------------

To increase scaling opportunities for startups by building capacity in entrepreneurs through Knowledge Sharing Workshops is of utmost essence. A Knowledge Exchange workshop to build capacity among the SCO Startup founders has been organised. Renowned professionals from the Indian startup ecosystem share their startup knowledge. The workshop also highlights the nuances of the startup ecosystem. Topics such as how to create a robust business model, how to identify the target audience, how to build a pitch deck, how to approach investors, how to manage a startup team, etc. comprise the topics of the workshop.
* Procuring Social Innovations
----------------------------

To create open procurement channels to enable matchmaking for procuring innovative solutions from startups, discussing avenues of Procuring Social Innovations is one of the focus areas. Forum 2021 includes a roundtable dedicated to Procuring Social Innovation. The roundtable aims to explore provisions in the public procurement process for providing access to Government markets to startups. The discussion highlights the role of startups working towards social innovation in the context of social problems faced by the SCO Member States.
* SCO Startup Showcase
--------------------

To feature innovative startups across sectors from the SCO Member States, a dedicated virtual platform has been curated. The virtual arena acts as a discovery platform with a repository of innovative startups across sectors from the SCO Member States. The startup showcase enables the entrepreneurs to display various features of their innovation, such as a business idea, founder details, product images, contact details, etc. The showcase aims to facilitate connections for startups not only with businesses and target consumers but also with Government bodies. [Explore](https://www.startupindia.gov.in/content/sih/en/sco.html)
* Sharing of Best Practices
-------------------------

To promote entrepreneurship and innovation by building lucrative channels of sharing of Best Practices are imperative. Forum 2021 launched the Knowledge Bank developed to showcase different elements of each SCO Member States such as details of their startup ecosystems, incubators, investors, policies, etc. The Knowledge Bank aims not only to serve as a guide to the startup stakeholders in the ecosystem but also to capsulate information that shall enable aspiring entrepreneurs to successfully pursue their journey.
