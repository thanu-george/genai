States' & UTs' Startup Policies

A State’s Startup Policy is critical in providing the essential funding, mentorship, and market access support required by startups to grow as important contributors to the State’s economy in terms of revenue and job creation. Additionally, it also contains provisions to incentivise key startup stakeholders such as incubators, and institutions of higher education among others so as to promote holistic development for India’s startup ecosystem. The Startup India team provides active support to States in formulation and operationalisation of their startup policies.

* Today, 31 of the 36 States and Union Territories have a dedicated Startup Policy.
* 27 of these Startup Policies were developed after the launch of the Startup India initiative in 2016.
* There is at least one DPIIT-recognised startup present in each of the 36 States and Union Territories.
* 653 Districts host at least one DPIIT-recognised startup.
