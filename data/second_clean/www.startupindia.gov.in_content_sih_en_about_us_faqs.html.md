[How do Investors add value to Startups?](#1487579167654)

Investors, particularly venture capitalists (VCs), add value to startups in a lot of ways: 

* *1\. Stakeholder Management**: Investors manage the company board and leadership to facilitate smooth operations of the startup. In addition, their functional experience and domain knowledge of working and investing with startups impart vision and direction to the company. 

* *2\. Raising Funds**: Investors are the best guides for the startup to raise subsequent rounds of funding on the basis of stage, maturity, sector focus, etc. and aid in networking and connection for the founders to pitch their business to other investors. 

* *3\. Recruiting Talent**: Sourcing high\-quality and best\-fit human capital is critical for startups, especially when it comes to recruiting senior executives to manage and drive business goals. VCs, with their extensive network, can help bridge the talent gap by recruiting the right set of people at the right time. 

* *4\. Marketing**: VCs assist with marketing strategy for your product/service. 

* *5\. M and A Activity**: VCs have their eyes and ears open to merger and acquisition opportunities in the local entrepreneurial ecosystem to enable greater value addition to the business through inorganic growth. 

* *6\. Organisational Restructuring**: As a young startup matures into an established company, VCs help with the right organisational structuring and introduce processes to increase capital efficiency, lower costs, and scale efficiently.

 Different investors use different criteria to judge an investment. The importance of these factors would vary depending on the stage of investment, sector of startup, management team, etc. Listed below are typical investment criteria used by investors:

* **Factors***: Customer relationships, stickiness to the product, vendor terms, existing vendors. 

* *5\. Competitive Analysis**: A true picture of competition and other players in the market working on similar things should be highlighted. There can never be an apple\-to\-apple comparison, but highlighting the service or product offerings of similar players in the industry is important.

* *8\. Exit Avenues:** A startup showcasingpotential future acquirers or alliance partners becomes a valuable decision parameter for the investor.

* *9\. Management and Team**: The execution and passion of the founder and the management team to drive the company is equally crucial in addition to all the factors mentioned above.

[How do Investors earn returns from investing in Startups?](#1494234008879)

 Investors realise their return on investment from startups through various means of exit. Ideally, the VC firm and the entrepreneur should discuss the various exit options at the beginning of investment negotiations. A well\-performing, high\-growth startup that also has excellent management and organisational processes is more likely to be exit\-ready earlier than other startups. 

 Venture capital and private equity funds must exit all their investments before the end of the fund’s life. The common exit methods are:

* *1\. Mergers and Acquisitions:** The investor may decide to sell the portfolio company to another company in the market. For example, the $140 million acquisition of RedBus by South African Internet and media giant Naspers and its integration with its India arm, Ibibo Group, presented an exit option for its investors, Seedfund, Inventus Capital Partners, and Helion Venture Partners. 

* *2\. IPO**: An initial public offering is the first time that the stock of a private company is offered to the public. Issued by private companies seeking capital to expand, it is one of the preferred options for investors looking to exit a startup organisation. 

* *3\. Exit to Financial Investors**: Investors may sell their investment to other venture capital or private equity firms.

* *4\. Distressed Sale**: Under financially stressed times for a startup company, the investors may decide to sell the business to another company or a financial institution.

* *5\. Buybacks**: Founders of the startup may also buy back their investment from the fund.

[What is a Term Sheet?](#1494234032870)

 A term sheet is a “Non\-binding” list of propositions by a venture capital firm at the beginning stages of a deal. It summarises the major points of engagement in the deal between the investment firm and the startup. 

 A term sheet for a venture capital transaction in India typically includes four structural provisions: valuation, investment and management structures, and changes to share capital. 

* *1\. Value**: Startup valuations are the total worth of the company as estimated by a professional valuer. There are various means of valuing a startup company, like the Cost to Duplicate approach, the Market Multiple approach, discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis, and the valuation\-by\-stage approach. Investors choose the relevant approach based on the stage of the investment and the market maturity of the startup. 

* *2\. Investment Structure**: It defines the mode of venture capital investment in the startup, whether it is through equity, debt, or a combination of both. 

* *3\. Management Structure**: The term sheet details the management structure of the company, including the composition of the board of directors and prescribed appointment and removal procedures. 

* *4\. Changes to share capital**: All investors in startups have their own investment timelines, and they accordingly seek flexibility in seeking exit options through subsequent rounds of funding. The term sheet addresses the stakeholders’ rights and obligations with respect to subsequent changes in the company’s share capital.
