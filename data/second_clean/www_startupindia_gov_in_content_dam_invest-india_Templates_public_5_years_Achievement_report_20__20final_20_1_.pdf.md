10 million5\-YEARS ACHIEVEMENT REPORT 111\. STARTUP INDIA: JOURNEY OF EVOLUTION
On 15 August 2015, as part of Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s Independence Day speech from the Red Fort,
a new vision for the Indian economy was announced. A vision that aimed to tap the entrepreneurial potential of the
people of India. A vision that enabled the talent of India to dream of ideas, put them in action, and convert them into
game changing ventures.
In five months, putting words into action, on 16 January 2016, the Government launched the ‘Startup India’ program with
a stated objective to build a strong ecosystem for nurturing innovation and startups in the country that would drive
sustainable economic growth and generate large scale employment opportunities.
1\.1 THE ACTION PLAN
In order to imbibe all these objectives under one umbrella policy framework for the entire nation, while addressing all
the aspects of the startup ecosystem, a Startup India Action Plan1 was announced on 16 January 2016\. It comprised of
19 action items spanning across three key areas of ‘simplification and handholding’, ‘funding support and incentives’,
and ‘industry\-academia partnerships and incubation’.
Under the provisions of this plan, startups were entitled to a number of benefits such as tax incentives including capital
gains tax exemption, Governments’ assistance in funding, prioritisation of startups in public procurement, etc. The
benefits above included a provision for startups to avail assistance of a self\-certification compliance system with
respect to labour and environmental laws and exemption from any inspections of their place of business. The action
plan also envisaged a common platform for stakeholders to interact, facilitation for funding support, and partnership
with academia and private sector entities. Some other key benefits that the Action Plan included were entitlement to
an 80% rebate in patent registration fees as well as a 50% rebate in trademark filing. Startups could also benefit from
faster exit norms and free of cost assistance provided by patent and trademark facilitators in filing for Intellectual
Property Rights (IPRs).

5\-YEARS ACHIEVEMENT REPORT 131\.2 STARTUP INDIA: THE CATALYST OF CHANGE
With an aim to operationalise its action plan towards a ‘pro\-entrepreneurship’ attitude, Startup India has created a
three\-pronged strategy
• to facilitate a common platform to connect the entire ecosystem while reducing information asymmetry,
• to provide benefits and other necessary support, and
• to engage regional entrepreneurs in transforming their ideas into business ventures.
While the first two are aimed at providing a one\-stop shop for startups, including availing financial incentives and other
benefits, the objective of the third point is to be achieved through outreach and awareness programs by taking the
message beyond metros to tier 2 and 3 cities and engaging regional governments in overall transformation.
The Action Plan under the Startup India Initiative was primarily focused on addressing the most vital issues faced by
entrepreneurs during various stages of their businesses and developing the Indian startup ecosystem to one of the
biggest startup ecosystems globally. Since the launch of Startup India and subsequent implementation of various
initiatives, substantial improvement has been created in the overall startup environment. Moreover, the Ease of
Doing Business index for India has made a significant leap from 130 in 2016 to 63 in 20202, further encouraging the
proliferation of startups in India.

5\-YEARS ACHIEVEMENT REPORT 252\.2 RECOGNITION: AN ADDED ADVANTAGE
As a part of the Startup India initiative, DPIIT\-recognised startups are eligible to avail a host of benefits such as self\-
certification, access to public procurement relaxations, tax incentives, etc. Over the span of the last four years, Startup
India has initiated regulatory and policy reforms for startups and startup ecosystem stakeholders, to make the
environment more favourable and attractive to operate in. Startup India has enabled 39 regulatory reforms with the
help of various ministries that are tailored for entrepreneurs and startup ecosystem stakeholders, to ease regulatory
burden and incentivise capital inflow into startups.
2\.2\.1 SELF\-CERTIFICATION UNDER ENVIRONMENTAL AND LABOR LAWS
An important area that startups consider risky is the
statutory aspect of running a business, as failure to meet all
legal requirements can land a startup in trouble. Established
startups are not just focused on managing their growth
but also spend a considerable amount of time on keeping
pace with the rapidly changing regulatory landscape of the
Indian law. Startup India has laid down several measures to
ease compliance with most complex laws for startups, to
ensure the associated risks are prevented or mitigated.
Under the initiative, startups have been allowed to self\-certify
under various labour and environmental compliances for
fixed durations of time. Startup India has collaborated with
various Ministries to provide such ease of functioning for
startups. Various States in India have also been encouraged
to incorporate such best practices, thus benefiting the national startup ecosystem. It is pertinent to note that the responsibility
of compliance is not a one\-time affair, but in fact a continuous process.
The Ministry of Environment, Forest \& Climate Change (MoEF\&CC) has published a list of 36 ‘white’ categories based on their
pollution load. Industrial sectors that have pollution index of below 20 are recognised as “white” wherein startups under the
category will be able to self\-certify compliance with respect to three Environment Laws for a period of three years, viz.
• The Water (Prevention \& Control of Pollution) Act, 1974
• The Water (Prevention \& Control of Pollution) Cess (Amendment) Act, 2003
• The Air (Prevention \& Control of Pollution) Act, 1981
Ministry of Labour and Employment (MoLE)6 has issued guidelines to State Governments whereby recognised
startups will be allowed to self\-certify compliance with respect to six labour laws, viz:
• The Building and Other Constructions Workers’ (Regulation of Employment \& Conditions of Service) Act, 1996
• The Inter\- State Migrant Workmen (Regulation of Employment \& Conditions of Service) Act, 1979
• The Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972
• The Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970
• The Employees’ Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952
• The Employees’ State Insurance Act, 1948

Shram Suvidha Portal, launched in 2014 under Ministry of Labour and Employment (MoLE), facilitates
businessmen to seek all types of registrations and submit returns that are required under labour laws through
a single online window.
Until February 2020, nine States (Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Uttar
Pradesh, Punjab, Uttarakhand, and Delhi) had integrated their regional portals with the Shram Suvidha
Additionally, as of February 2020, 15 States had complied with the self\-certification advisory for five years, and 12 States
had complied with the advisory for three years, cumulatively benefitting 169 startups which have availed the benefits of
self \-certification and hence, have led to saving their valuable time during their initial stages to focus more on their core
businesses. Further, recognising the need for expedited compliances, MoLE has provisioned startups to avail special
benefits through the Shram Suvidha Portal, such as, increasing Self\-Certification duration from three years to five years
for compliances related to provident funds (EPFO), employees’ state insurances (ESIC), \& labour laws (CLC(C)), with
exemption from physical verifications. These measures have brought in further ease of doing business under a regime
that strives to be more supportive to the startup environment.

Procurement” or “public procurement” (or ‘Purchase’, or ‘Government Procurement/ Purchase’ in certain contacts)
means acquisition by way of purchase, lease, license or otherwise, either using public funds or any other source of
funds (e.g. grant, loans, gifts, private investment etc.) of goods, works or services or any combination thereof, including
award of Public Private Partnership projects, by a Procuring Entity, whether directly or through an agency with which
a contract for procurement services is entered into, but does not include any acquisition of goods, works or services
without consideration, and the term “procure” or “procured” shall be construed accordingly; With an aim to involve
startups in public procurement, Startup India has spearheaded several key amendments to enhance the growth of
startups by opening doors to new avenues for startups in public tenders. Currently, all Startup India recognised entities
are exempted from submission of Earnest Money Deposits (EMD)/ Bid Security under public procurement, thereby
addressing a substantial barrier of capital locking while participation in tendering processes. Relaxation in conditions
of prior turnover and prior experience for DPIIT recognised startups in public procurement subject to meeting of quality
and technical specifications have further enabled competition with established firms.
RELAXED ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:
Rule 170 (i) of GFR 2017: exemption from submission of EMD /Bid Security
in public procurement tenders.
Also, Rule 173 (i) has been incorporated in GFR, 2017: relaxation of
conditions of prior turnover and prior experience for DPIIT recognised
startups in all government tender requests.

“ We have built an innovative emission control technology to reduce emission from diesel generators (DG sets)
used extensively for power back up across India. Being an innovation driven hardware startup, we did face some
unique challenges and the Startup India initiative by The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade
has been very helpful to overcome some of these challenges. We are a recognised startup by the Government
of India and received financial assistance on the patent we filed for our unique technology. We were also given
relief from various labour laws during the early stage to ensure that we spend most of our time and energy on
bringing our innovation to life.
Under the Startup India initiative, we got the opportunity to meet various officials from multiple Ministries to
advocate for changes in rules and regulations and create a robust eco system for clean\-tech ventures like
ours. This ensured that our efforts were aligned to the larger objectives of the government and we could play
a meaningful role in the development of the country. We are also the beneficiaries of the Startup portal on
Government e\-Marketplace (GeM). The portal ensured that we could work with large public sector undertakings
at a very early stage of our journey. It also eliminated the long tendering process and ensured we could work with
the government in a fast and transparent way. With the funding round led by IAN Fund in April 2019, we have been
able to create over 70 jobs in the manufacturing sector and also build intellectual property to contribute towards
India’s growth and prosperity. The funding has also helped us build manufacturing and engineering capabilities
to be able to partner with large and established corporations at a very early stage in our journey. We boast
of having technical capabilities superior to corporations with over 50 years of experience. This acceleration in
Innovation has been possible due to the financial support provided by the government under the Fund of Funds
scheme. We are on track to create over 100 jobs in the manufacturing sector by the end of this financial year
and scale up our operations to improve the air quality in multiple Indian cities including Delhi NCR, Chennai, Pune,
Lucknow and Bangalore.

5\-YEARS ACHIEVEMENT REPORT 332\.2\.4 TAX INCENTIVES
In order to provide added financial support to the ecosystem and promote infusion of capital through investors, tax
exemptions have been implemented. These enable startups to meet their policy goals and reduce the tax system’s
administrative burdens.
INCOME TAX INCENTIVES
Startup India took upon itself to resolve, one of the key barriers to startups, taxes, by not only simplifying the processes
involved, but also exempting startups from taxes under certain eligibility. While the indirect taxation reform in the form
of Goods and Services Tax (GST) has helped in greater formalisation and simplification of the Indian tax regime, the
taxation slabs have required further reforms to support entrepreneurial growth. Reduced outflow of cash amounts to
savings, further accelerating reinvestment into startups. Tax incentives have thereby helped startups to a great extent
especially in the initial stages of their lifecycle.
With a view to stimulate the development of startups in India and provide them with a competitive platform, the
profits and gains derived by an eligible startup from eligible business may get 100% exemption for three consecutive
assessment years out of seven years from the year of its incorporation.
In order to further rationalise the provisions relating to startups, the Finance Act provided for an amendment in section
80\-IAC of the Income Tax Act so as to provide that the deduction under the said section shall be available to an eligible
startup for a period of three consecutive assessment years out of 10 beginning from the year in which it is incorporated.
This amendment will take effect from 1st April 2021\.
To avail the benefits under the Income Tax Act, a startup must get a certificate of eligibility from the Inter\-Ministerial Board
(IMB) of Certification. The Board comprises of Joint Secretary, Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade
(DPIIT), Representative of Department of Biotechnology, and Representative of Department of Science \& Technology.
PROVISIONS UNDER SECTION 80\-IAC OF THE INCOME TAX ACT10:
(i) “Eligible Business” means a business carried out by an eligible startup
engaged in innovation, development or improvement of products or processes
or services or a scalable business model with a high potential for employment
generation or wealth creation;
(ii) “Eligible Startup” means a company or a limited liability partnership engaged
in eligible business which fulfils the following conditions, namely:
(a) It is incorporated on or after the 1st day of April 2016 but before the 1st day
Provisions under (b) The total turnover of its business does not exceed Rs 100 crore \[in the
Section 80\-IAC of the previous year relevant to the assessment year for which deduction under sub\-
Income Tax Act section (1\) is claimed]; and
(c) It holds a certificate of eligible business from the Inter\-Ministerial Board of
Certification as notified in the Official Gazette by the central Government
A DPIIT\-recognised startup is eligible to apply to the Inter\-Ministerial Board for full deduction on the profits and gains from
business (exemption under Section 80\-IAC of the Income Tax Act) provided the following conditions are fulfilled. The entity

5\-YEARS ACHIEVEMENT REPORT 35EXEMPTIONS ON INVESTMENTS ABOVE FACE VALUE
DPIIT\-recognised startups are exempted from tax under Income Tax Act on the amount exceeding Fair Market value
of shares for issue of shares above the face value. The startup has to provide a duly signed self\-declaration in Form 2
which is sent to Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) to claim exemption from the provisions of Section 56(2\) (viib) of
Tax on investments above face value is a tax rule applicable to investments by Indian residents in the capital raised
by private limited companies via issue of shares. It was introduced as an anti\-abuse provision in the 2012 Budget to
restraint attempts to launder undisclosed income. The tax was charged at an effective rate of over 30% (till FY 19\) on
investments in shares “above face value” made at a premium. Such an investment attracted the provisions of Section
56(2\) (viib) of the Income Tax Act under which the excess premium was taxed under the head “income from other
sources”. Many startups had raised concerns on having received notices from the Income Tax department on the
funds raised in the angel round.
The idea of taxation began to restrict angel investors from planting their money and trust in inexperienced and early\-
stage startups. Different valuation models determined different values basis projections and future growth assumptions
that could vary from the net asset value of the business. This prevented people from starting a business in India as
30% of the capital raised went in taxes. Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade(DPIIT) recognised the
gravity of hardship that the formulated tax regime was having on startups and held deliberations with CBDT on carving
a way out for startups and eventually modified the criteria.

5\-YEARS ACHIEVEMENT REPORT 37REVIVING INVESTMENTS: A WALKTHROUGH
When startups raised funds from Indian unlisted firms / individual investors at a price above face value, the consideration
received in excess of the Fair Market Value was taxed at rate of 30% as income from other sources of the startups under
the provisions of section 56(2\) (viib) of the Income Tax Act. It was introduced as an anti\-abuse provision in the 2012
Budget to restraint attempts to launder undisclosed income. The levy of this tax gravely impacted startup valued on
business potential, innovation in ideas, and intangible assets. Valuation models such as Discounted Cash Flow and
future growth assumptions lead to a difference in the estimate when compared to the Net Asset Value of the business,
which could be much lower.
Many startups started receiving notices under Section 56(2\) (viib) from the Income Tax department on the funds raised
in seed funding round by them, thus restricting some investors from planting their money in early\-stage startups. Seed
investment in startups generally precedes any investment by Venture Capital Funds (VCF) which were exempt from
the said provisions. This, in turn, began a ripple effect, preventing more people from coming forward and starting their
businesses as more than 30% of their capital raised was foregone. This concern was raised by startups, private equity
funds, and various startup associations.
DPIIT recognised the gravity of this hardship and deciphered that many unlisted early\-stage startups rely heavily on
funding from such investors to build the base for getting further funding from VCFs
in next rounds. It could sense growing resentment in the startup ecosystem towards
the Government. DPIIT decided to take up the issue and bring the entire gamut of
concerns to the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), Department of Revenue’s
notice. It raised the issue and various concerns that were hovering around it to CBDT
and requested it to reduce the severity of such hefty tax provisions on startups. It
was “highlighted” that the harsh taxation norms were pulling down startups which
relied heavily on seed investors and were acting as a regressive force in the process
With the support of CBDT, DPIIT issued a notification in April 2018 in supersession to the
earlier notifications. This notification instated a carve out for eligible startups providing
them exemption from the provisions of section 56(2\) (viib) subject to fulfilment of
certain conditions. These conditions included aspects around the maximum amount
of permissible paid\-up share capital in the startup, minimum returned income or
Net Worth of the investor, and the requirement of the startup to obtain a merchant
banker report stipulating the fair market value of shares determined as per the
stipulated Income\-tax Rules, 1962\. In this case, the application had to be made to the
Inter\-Ministerial Board which was entitled to grant or decline the requisite exemption.
However, the notification still needed to achieve a lot more in order to reach the milestone defined by DPIIT. This
was because the conditions laid down for claiming the said exemptions had severe requirements for the investor
to disclose his returned income or net worth. Many of these investors were asked to provide details on Permanent
Account Number (PAN), bank statements, income computation, and other documents. This enhanced the feeling of
harassment in many angel investors who would have otherwise found it easier and more convenient to invest in real
estate or share market or in startups abroad.
“The Startup India team has been instrumental in the growth of the Indian startup ecosystem as it has worked
tirelessly to address the concerns of Indian startups and investors and has become a champion for the
ecosystem. The work it has actioned on a policy level has made AIFs an attractive asset\-class for both Indian
and global investors. The recognition of AIFs as a well\-regulated, institutional investor has allowed it to gain
exemptions from section 56(2\) (viib) (dubbed the “Angel Tax”) and section 68\. By allowing for AIFs to have pass\-
through status on losses, the structure has become more commercially attractive and will go a long way. In
India’s dream to become a $ 5 trillion economy by 2025, startups and new\-age businesses are supposed to
contribute $ 1 trillion. Startup India’s role as an ecosystem enabler will be crucial to achieving this monumental
5\-YEARS ACHIEVEMENT REPORT 37Startups, on the other hand, began relocating outside India to be able to raise capital given the dearth of investors
willing to invest in the Indian market. Furthermore, the requirement to obtain a valuation report from a merchant
banker attracted hefty costs for startups in their early stages when they were struggling for survival. DPIIT again
became a platform for startups and their investors to address this issue. To protect bona fide investments into
startups, DPIIT took the matter of issuance of Income Tax notices to startups and investors with the Department
of Revenue (DoR). In light of the situation, CBDT directed the Assessing Officers to not take any coercive action for
recovery of tax dues and to set up a committee to review the issue.
DPIIT organised a roundtable in February 2019 to address the matters still hovering over startups and investors. The
roundtable was attended by the DoR representatives from various industry bodies, private equity, and startups
who raised key issues being faced by them in the ecosystem concerning this tax. Acknowledging the situation and
hardships being faced by startups, CBDT extended its support further to liberalise the norms of section 56(2\) (viib).
DPIIT could thereby issue a ground\-breaking notification on 19th February 2019 that serviced various issues of startups
and investors and increased the horizon of startup definition to accommodate more entities under the Startup India
scheme and its benefits.
Further, DPIIT initiated exemption to all sub\- categories of Category I Alternative Investments Funds (AIFs) and
Category II AIFs from the said provisions. DPIIT continuously seeks to boost startups and address regulatory hardships
being faced by them.
The time period for which an entity could be considered a startup was increased from 7 years to 10 years and the
turnover criteria was increased from Rs 25 CRORES TO Rs 100 CRORES.
Furthermore, a recognised startup could claim exemption from the provisions of section 56(2\) (viib) of the Income
Tax Act subject to meeting the conditions that:
i. it has been recognised by DPIIT
ii. aggregate amount of paid\-up share capital and share premium of the startup after issue or proposed issue of
share, if any, does not exceed Rs 25 crore,
it has not invested in any of the assets specified in the notification G.S.R. 127 (E) dated February 19, 2019 issued by DPIIT
Notification13\.
The startup has to file a duly signed declaration in Form 2 to DPIIT \[as per notification G.S.R. 127 (E)] to claim the
exemption from the provisions of Section 56(2\) (viib) of the Income Tax Act.
“Startup India’s work on Angel Tax has been very helpful for us. Their work led to an exemption being
granted. It came at the right time as the Income Tax department had served us with a notice. We had
adhered to every rule and had every document in place. Still, we were very worried about the time and
money that a response and subsequent hearings would suck up. The quotes that we received from CAs
confirmed our fears. Thankfully, the exemption came in time and we could just attach that in reply. Just
like that, we were done and a load off my head!”

A complex and tedious winding\-up process was yet another restriction for startup enthusiasts as it was considered
that “shutting down a company is far more difficult than starting a company. The costs involved in closure were few
of the main reasons why several firms had continued to remain dormant without legally shutting operations. They
would be required to bear costs for maintenance and compliance with annual filings, failing which would entail penal
consequences by the relevant authorities.

5\-YEARS ACHIEVEMENT REPORT 453\. FUND OF FUNDS FOR STARTUPS
The Fund of Funds (FFS) for startups has been established to provide funding
support for development and growth of innovation driven enterprises as well
as to address one of the key challenges faced by startups in India i.e. access to
risk capital. Due to lack of collateral, uncertain cash flows and unconventional
business models, startups are unable to raise financing through traditional
sources such as banks and Non\-Banking Financial Companies (NBFC). Besides
this, the high\-risk nature of startups, wherein a significant percentage fail,
reduces their investment attractiveness for traditional financiers.
The Fund has been structured as a Fund of Funds, which means that it does
not invest directly in startups but rather participates in the capital of Securities
and Exchange Board of India (SEBI)\-registered Category\-1 and Category\-2
Alternate Investment Funds (AIFs). The tenure of the AIF supported under FFS
will be initially up to 12 years. The FFS is managed by Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI), which has issued
its operational guidelines. The AIFs supported by FFS shall invest at least twice the amount of contribution received
from FFS in startups qualifying as per the Gazette Notification G.S.R.501 (E) dated 23 May 2017, issued by Government of
India and as amended from time to time. The aggregate contribution to the corpus of AIFs from Fund of Funds being
operated by different Ministries of the Government of India / State Governments shall not exceed 35% of its corpus.
The Fund of Funds shall have representation on the governance structure/ board of the venture fund based on the
The Fund of Funds was set\-up in 2016 with a total corpus of Rs 10,000 Crores to be built over the 14th and 15th Finance
Commission constituted by Government of India. As of 1st December 2020, SIDBI had committed Rs 4326\.95 Crores to
60 AIFs, which have raised a total corpus of Rs 31,598 Crores, an 7X catalysing effect. Rs 1,270\.46 Crores have been drawn
from the FFS by 51 AIFs, which have funded 384 startups and Rs 4509\.16 Crores have been invested in 384 startups
Addressing the financing challenges faced by startups in India for and the high
risk nature of startups wherein a significant percentage fail to take\-off, thus
hampering their investment attractiveness, Government of India has set up a
fund with A TOTAL CORPUS OF RS 10,000 CRORE.
“ Startup India is a great catalyst for the overall startup ecosystem. Personally, we have benefited because of
their low cost service initiative\- fund of funds programme. One of our investors has taken capital from SIDBI’s
Fund of Funds scheme which was indirectly invested in us. We are also recognized by the Government for our
innovation which indirectly helped us build brand in the early days. Also, the response from the entire team is
very prompt and professional”

5\-YEARS ACHIEVEMENT REPORT 67Testimonial: Facilitation Support provided by Startup India to an Upcoming Startup
Through this blog post, I wanted to share my story and the role of Startup India in supporting me in my
entrepreneurship journey. When I first faced the facts, I couldn’t believe how something as innocuous as our
garbage could be negatively connected to so many of my personal concerns. I wanted to stop being a part of
the problem. I had to address my own trash problem first. My solution – live a lifestyle that best reflected the values
I cared about. I had called myself an environmentalist for about six years at the time. I studied environmental
planning, environmental policy, and environmental economics in college and graduate school, but I thought I
needed to live a life more congruent to my environmental and social justice values. In my zero\-waste journey,
I realised we lived in a world with LANDFILL destined products. Toothbrushes for instance\- 4\.7 billion of them
end in the landfill every year, take 200\-700 years to start decomposing. So, every toothbrush you and I have
ever produced is sitting on our planet somewhere! In response to this problem, I wanted to create a company
that mirrored the values of zero waste, ethical consumption, and sustainability. I wanted to make it easy and
accessible for other people looking to consume more mindfully, and to encourage others to produce less waste.
Thus, Bare Necessities was born.
At Bare Necessities, it’s not just about selling products. It’s about encouraging an earth friendly lifestyle. In the
larger sense, BN seeks to change the narrative on waste in India. In the future, Bare Necessities seeks to become
an interdisciplinary hub, a home for product designers to design products with a cradle to cradle philosophy,
a place for policy analysts to work with local government on policy recommendations to manage our waste
better, and to reduce our waste. A place for behaviour economics, ecologists, researchers and consumers alike
to build the ecosystem towards a circular economy.
In March 2020, I was fortunate enough to be a part of the CII\-Startup India delegation to attend the India\- Bhutan
Startup Summit in Bhutan. I had the amazing opportunity to learn all about the gross happiness index from the
PM of Bhutan himself, among senior leaders from the Chamber of Commerce and UNDP in Bhutan. I met amazing
Bhutanese entrepreneurs, and got to travel and know some of my fellow Indian entrepreneurs. Additionally, I
had the opportunity to attend SLUSH in Helsinki, Finland. SLUSH is a world famous startup event! A gathering of
more than 20,000 change\-makers, including thousands of startups and investors. One of my favourite sessions
was talking about breaking taboos and building future companies for the next generation with Andrea Barrica,
Valentina Milanova and Sophia Bendz! So grateful for this opportunity, thank you Startup India. Lastly, I wanted to
share that Bare Necessities won the ‘Single\-use Plastic Challenge’ organised by Startup India. Plastic pollution is
something that has been often overlooked for many years. We are currently living in the largest global garbage
crisis of our lifetime. I am extremely glad that there was a competition hosted around such an important issue.
We additionally were invited to do a pitch with Amity University Incubation Lab.
Startup India has helped facilitate a variety of competitions, national and international opportunities, and more.
The most beneficial being: Through financial initiatives, Startup competitions such as (the Single\-use Plastic
Challenge), and International startup opportunities \-

5\-YEARS ACHIEVEMENT REPORT 6710\. INNOVATION CHALLENGE TO DEVELOP PORTABLE DEVICE FOR
WATER QUALITY TESTING
DPIIT, in partnership with the National Jal Jeevan Mission (NJJM), Department of Drinking Water \& Sanitation, launched
an Innovation Challenge to develop ‘portable devices for testing drinking water quality’.
Drinking water supply in rural areas is from both from groundwater (80%) and surface water (20%) sources. However,
due to depleting groundwater level, especially in arid and semi\-arid regions, the use of surface water is on the rise. For
both groundwater and surface water based rural drinking water supply systems, it is important to measure relevant
area\-specific contaminations to ensure access to potable water. The Uniform Drinking Water Quality Protocol, 2019 has
specified some important parameters to be monitored for assuring potability of drinking water as per BIS IS 10500:2012
(Second Version) and subsequent amendments.
People receiving piped water supply in their homes do not have any means to test the potability of water coming from
their tap. This leads to a situation wherein, quite often, people are reluctant to consume tap water directly. People in
urban areas end up installing household water treatment unit incurring additional expenditure.
To facilitate and empower people to test drinking water quality at their homes and assure potability of water, there is
a need for ‘portable water quality testing devices’ that can test the quality of water for important parameters.
Applications were opened for this challenged from 18th December till 18th January 2021\.

5\-YEARS ACHIEVEMENT REPORT 79Testimonial: Startup India’s Handholding Support and Recognition to a Startup
I, Dr. Vanita Prasad, am the founder of REVY Environmental Solutions Pvt. Ltd. My research bent has always been
in analysing challenges and looking for innovative solutions. However, due to lack of resources and funds, I kept
my ideas on hold for a long time. Having learnt about Government of India schemes to support startups, I was
motivated to embark on the journey of entrepreneurship.
During this journey, we got handholding support and recognition by Startup India. We were recognized as
winners in the Indo Israel Innovation Challenge in the category of ‘Low energy and cost effective sustainable
solutions for waste water treatment’ organized by Startup India, this worked as a booster for our cause.. We also
got a chance to collaborate with Israeli companies and are currently working with them. Further in this journey,
to fulfil the mission of Swachh Bharat, we also focussed on the treatment of Biodegradable waste, sewage, and
industrial effluents contaminating the fresh water resources of India. This helped us win the ‘Swachh Bharat
Grand Challenge’ under the aegis of the Swachchta Pakhwada in Waste Management category organized by
Startup India.
Further, with the support from a very cohesive and well \- integrated startup ecosystem that has been built in
India in line with the Government’s mission to promote entrepreneurship and innovation in the country, Invest
India’s Integrate to Innovate (i2i) Program helped us get connected with Exxon mobile. This unique collaboration
supported us in addressing the growing need of treating produced water as and helped in commercializing our
offering, improving its competitive positioning, and generating larger revenue.
Also, having DPIIT recognition and now access to a host of tax benefits, easier compliance, fast\-tracking of
IPR have indeed helped us grow and expand at a faster rate. Presently, we are scaling up our operation and
reach within Gujarat and have plans to ramp it up further as national solution provider. Our vision is to strive for
innovation and provide economically feasible, eco\-friendly and sustainable solutions to our customers.
Thank You Startup India for supporting, guiding, and motivating us in our entrepreneurial journey!!”

building their startup community.
5\-YEARS ACHIEVEMENT REPORT 83FEEDBACK AND EVALUATION PROCESS
For the purpose of evaluation, implementation of action points and feedback from startup ecosystem components
had been given due weightage. As part of ranking methodology, for each action point where feedback is to be
collected; minimum 30 beneficiaries were selected on random basis from the entire pool of beneficiaries. If the total
pool comprised of less than 30 beneficiaries, all were selected. Feedback was sought from startups recognised under
Startup India and other relevant ecosystem components registered under Startup India Hub. The feedback was
collected by the call center under the Startup India Hub Team.
The approach towards the States’ Startup Ranking Framework is based on DPIIT consulted all stakeholders

5\-YEARS ACHIEVEMENT REPORT 89FEEDBACK AND EVALUATION PROCESS
For the purpose of evaluation, all States and UTs had been divided into two categories – Category X and Category Y.
Category X entailed States with a well\-established startup ecosystem. Category Y included all UTs, except Delhi, and all
states in North East India, except Assam.
The State/ UT Startup Ranking Exercise required states and UTs to share supporting documents under each action point,
these documents serve as evidence for the progress under the concerned action points. Some of the documents
include state policies, amendments, a list of startups, acknowledge letters, proof of fund release, and event reports.
Post the submission, process Startup India Team conducted an interim assessment to ensure that the documents
submitted by the states adhered to the norms and guidelines of the framework. This is a crucial step as it ensures that
all submitted documents are complete, accurate, and valid.
Dedicated Evaluation Committees (EC) were appointed to analyse these documentary evidences from the states.
These committees comprised of independent experts from the startup ecosystem to assess each pillar of the ranking
framework. The members were a mix of experts from the Government and private organisations.
A parallel exercise of feedback collection was conducted by an external agency appointed by DPIIT. Out of the total
of 30 Action Points, 25 Action points were selected to collect feedback from the direct beneficiaries. The feedback
collection mechanism was driven through an online system to ensure transparency in the feedback exercise.
States’ responses were evaluated for both supporting documents and feedback components. Based on approved
supporting documents and data from the feedback exercise, all the participating states were grouped based on merit.
The entire exercise took two rounds of assessment and 14 EC meetings to finally arrive at a conclusion.

STATES AT THE FOREFRONT OF PROMOTING POLICIES IN DISRUPTIVE SECTORS
Global economies are driven by advances in disruptive technology areas such as Artificial
Intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), Nanotechnology, and Genomics. These advances
affect every aspect of society which includes industrial strategies and competitiveness; labor
market and the way the government functions. Furthermore, innovation is the key to every
economy to grow and takes place in every layer of society. As per the Global Innovation
Index 2016, India has improved its global ranking by 15 places. Honourable Prime Minister of
India has declared 2010\-20 as the decade of innovation to unleash the creative potential of
every Indian.
As observed, policies can drive innovation in established industries and deepen the
advantages of incumbent technologies and companies. As a result, it has become
imperative to pursue changes in policy in conjunction with changes in technologies and
business models. This ideology has led to many states in India taking initiatives to facilitate
the growth of startups working in disruptive technology areas.
In order to facilitate this, some states have worked on sector\-specific policies or have
specified additional incentives for technology\-drives startups. Such foundations play an
important role in giving startups in disruptive sectors a direction and an additional push to
quickly scale\-up and create an impact.

awareness about the Indian Startup ecosystem \& provide mentorship to budding entrepreneurs, provide Incubation
offers to the best talent within Tier 2/3 districts of the States, and provide other incentives from the resource partners of
Startup India such as legal consultation, advisory services, mentorship, cash prizes, etc.
The Yatra initiative also conducted knowledge and activity based sessions wherein startup enthusiasts were imparted
deeper understanding of the culture of entrepreneurship , emerging technologies, and processes involved in stagewise
development of a startup.
As a part of this initiative the ‘Startup India Mobile Van’ was launched that travelled throughout participating States to
record ideas during the workshops.. The ideas selected were further evaluated and rewarded to mentor the Next Gen

well by the execution partners of the Yatra. We started off on 27th September from the Jammu Campus of our

where there was no exposure for ground level innovators to get access to the world of business. We are really
thankful to the Minister of Commerce and Industry, Mr. Suresh Prabhu and “Startup India Yatra”, which allowed
us to participate in the event at Sambalpur, Odisha. This gave us all the support and strength to convert our
idea and concept to build a business around it \- with its series of mentoring sessions by Startup India team and
connecting us with the right set of networking base. Out of three verticals, which we thought of initially, today we
have solutions developed for two verticals which are being deployed at customer sites and going through BETA.
The third vertical is under development and we are confident that being connected with Startup India we are
going to be successful here as well.

India Yatra team and Assam Startup team in the state and all stakeholders including education Institutions were

“The Startup India Mizoram Yatra happened at a time when the State was moving full swing in creating and
facilitating a vibrant entrepreneurial and startup eco\-system in Mizoram which commenced not long ago in
2017 with the launch of the State’s comprehensive Entrepreneurship Development Scheme (EDS). The Mizoram
leg of the Startup India Yatra helped boost the nascent entrepreneurial ecosystem building initiative undertaken
by the Department. The Startup India team and Yatra team were a delight to work with. We did not fail to notice
that the Startup Teams did their best to avoid burdening the State Government and to manage the logistics of
the Yatra themselves, even perhaps to their own detriment. Kudos to them. Despite the unfriendly terrain, the
unpredictable weather and cultural peculiarities of the land, the Startup India Mizoram Yatra was successfully
completed in a manner that benefitted the greatest possible number of people. The Startup India Mizoram Yatra
