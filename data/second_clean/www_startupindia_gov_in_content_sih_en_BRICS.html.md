BRICS is a pivotal grouping that has emerged as a powerful force in shaping the global economic landscape, dedicated to fostering cooperation in areas such as trade, investment, technology, and global governance. Initially comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, the bloc expanded following the 2023 BRICS summit, which formally invited Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, and the United Arab Emirates to join. In 2025, Indonesia became a full member, further enhancing the group’s global influence.
Today, BRICS nations collectively represent approximately 3\.3 billion people, accounting for over 40% of the world’s population. Their economies contribute an estimated 37\.3% of global GDP, reflecting their significant economic weight. The grouping, boasting massive consumer markets and workforce populations, has emerged as a key engine of global economic expansion, underscoring its significant role in reshaping the international economic order.

## BRICS Startup Knowledge Hub
 Startups are at the forefront of driving economic growth, technological innovation, and societal impact globally, playing a pivotal role in shaping the future. Recognizing this, fostering cross\-border exchange of knowledge, expertise, and resources is essential for the holistic development of startups and their ecosystems across BRICS nations. Collaboration among them is essential to achieve the SDGs to reduce poverty, promote entrepreneurship, provide employment opportunities, and generate sustainable livelihoods across the world. [With this vision, the BRICS Startup Forum was announced in 2021, during India’s Presidency. The BRICS Startup Forum aims to promote cross\-border collaboration through various entrepreneurial activities amongst the BRICS nations.
The BRICS Startup Knowledge Hub was launched on 31st January 2025 as part of the BRICS Startup Forum. [The Agenda for the program may be found here. The BRICS Startup Knowledge Hub (microsite) is the first\-ever BRICS Startup Knowledge Repository which lays the foundation for multilateral cooperation and engagement among the BRICS countries to develop and hone their startup ecosystems. The Knowledge Repository aims to enable startups, investors, incubators, and aspiring entrepreneurs of BRICS countries to collaborate and exchange knowledge.
The Knowledge Hub will serve as a one\-stop gateway to the BRICS startup ecosystem, offering valuable insights into the unique entrepreneurial landscapes of each member country. As a dynamic engagement platform and comprehensive digital resource, it will bridge the gap between startups, investors, and stakeholders, unlocking opportunities for collaboration and growth within the BRICS nations.
