Testimonials
------------

‹›

> Qualcomm collaborated with Invest India to reach out and register for its Qualcomm Design in India Challenge. The Invest India team was very engaged from the beginning, following up timely with us on all aspects. The platform for registration was very simple and easy to use, which made it easy not only to publish the program but also to sort through the submissions. If there was any technical issue, the Invest India team was quick to resolve it.

##### Pushkar Apte

Associate Director, Business Development, Qualcomm India

> It is a pleasure to have Invest India and Startup India as our partners for the Prosus Social Impact Challenge for Accessibility (SICA). Their support was instrumental in getting Prosus SICA off the ground and led to more than 200 startups from throughout India taking part in the search for innovations that can positively impact the lives of persons with disabilities. And most importantly, we value the contribution of the team who worked in step with us and ensured that SICA was truly a shared initiative. We look forward to working with Invest India and Startup India for bigger, more impactful editions!

##### Sehraj Singh

Director, Prosus, India

> As always, the Startup India team has been greatly helpful and proactive, especially in terms of validation of applications and help in onboarding experts from the startup ecosystem for the evaluation process. I thank you and your team for your immense contribution to the success of BPCL Startup Grand Slam season\#1 so far.

##### Rahul Tandon

General Manager (Corporate \& Digital Strategy), Bharat Petroleum Corporate Limited, Mumbai

> I would like to compliment Invest India AgNii and Startup India for their ongoing efforts in boosting the innovation ecosystem across the country. Cisco LaunchPad brings together Cisco technologies, startups, and the partner community to deliver business\-relevant end\-to\-end solutions. We at Cisco LaunchPad had invited potential deep tech startups to join hands on our digital transformation journey. Through the marquee Startup India platform as well as their strong connections in the startup ecosystem, we were able to shortlist a couple of high\-quality startups for our engagement. I would like to acknowledge the role of InvestIndia, Agnii, and Startup India in actively facilitating the discovery of startups and would like to especially commend their highly professional and passionate approach to developing the startup and innovation ecosystem.

##### Sruthi Kannan

Program Manager, Cisco Launchpad

> It was great working with the Startup India Team. The support received from them was commendable. The collaboration with Startup India and AGNII helped Infineon Technologies launch a successful campaign and reach out to individuals and startups to get solutions for our problem statement.

##### Shubha Sudheer

Senior Specialist \- Emerging applications, Infineon Technologies

> The Invest India team goes beyond the call of duty to make things happen. If you work with them, then success is a shared goal. They are passionate about making "your" dream come true by being a "true partner," who gives advice, takes responsibility, and makes things happen.

##### Jappreet Sethi

CEO, Hexgn

> Anthill Worked with Invest India during its India immersion program held in January 2020\. With the goal of enabling Singaporean startups to enter the Indian market, Anthill turned to the Invest India team to guide its cohort of HealthTech startups on Startup India, Government policies, and the general landscape. The team did a great job of presenting to the startups and then meeting them one\-on\-one to further clarify their questions and to provide advice on their market entry plans. It is our belief that interactions with the Invest India team brought value to our cohort and overall program offering.

##### Zaran Bhagwagar

Program Manager, Anthill Ventures

> I was immensely surprised and pleased at the same time to see the variety of innovations that came to the forefront in one of the challenges that was sponsored by RB. Interestingly, the rural participation of the application was on par with urban cities, which itself is a statement to the wide network StartUp India has built—Reckitt Benckiser.

##### Anirudh Hingle

Open Innovation, Reckitt Benckiser

> Start\-up India is a trustworthy ecosystem platform that draws all stakeholders in a very inclusive manner. In my view, it is the go\-to place for startups, investors, and everyone who wants to contribute to the growth of new India. Be it with new ideas, new products, or new execution models, this is where the action is. I would definitely say the Startup India team was a big part of our program's collective success. The team has been very diligent in providing feedback on what is working and not working and having a suitable mechanism of dialogue. Today, as startups are trying to solve bigger problems and experiment with greater ease, it is thanks to the Startup India team working tirelessly to bring all players together for success.
