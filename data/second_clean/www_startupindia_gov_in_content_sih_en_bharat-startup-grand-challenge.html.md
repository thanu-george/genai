# Testimonials
> At Zuron, we are building the world's first neurocomputing\-based digital gaming console. The idea is—can you play physically through movements in the digital world? And when you play this game, can we look into your brain health and your entire biomechanic, which could help you live longer and happier?
> Our idea was—can we use this stimulation potential to help people improve their overall condition? Be it neurodevelopmental conditions in kids like autism, ADHD, learning disability, cerebral palsy, so on and so forth; or be it neurodegenerative diseases in elders—be it Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, dementia; or in normal adults—be it metabolic conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, PCOD, so on and so forth. So the idea was—can we use game for healthcare? And that could help people go.

> And that led us to build a complete console which could actually do the same thing and thereby help you not only improve your potential with regards to your profession but also give you a very happy and long life.

> We are really excited to be part of Chartup Bahum and thanks to WZO for giving us this opportunity and the challenge that they've brought in in BHARAT Startup Grand Challenge for Gaming for Good focusing on healthcare. It was really a good initiative for us, and I think it's tailor\-made for what we have done because we brought in AI together, healthcare together, and gaming—all the three booming segments together—and that actually has culminated to this victory for us. We are really happy to be part of this entire mega event that's been happening in Delhi.
