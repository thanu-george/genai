[What is Public Procurement?](#1545892390216)



**Governments, just like private companies, have to buy goods and services for their operational needs.**



**Public procurement refers to the process by which governments and state\-owned enterprises purchase goods and services from the private sector. As public procurement utilises a substantial portion of taxpayers' money, governments are expected to follow strict procedures to ensure that the process is fair, efficient, transparent and minimises wastage of public resources.**

[How Can Public Procurement Benefit My Startup?](#1545892390216)



**In India, public procurement (government tenders) can also present useful pilot opportunities for startups that have not yet been able to gain traction in the private sector.**



**Conversely, opening government tenders up to startups improves the choices available to government bodies since startups are often more agile than corporate vendors and can provide cheaper, more innovative products and services.**

A system of counter bidding may be deployed for procurement from startups for innovative products shortlisted through the challenge. The startups would need to submit an online proposal detailing out the uniqueness of their product, the value add for airport etc. Based on the RFP, AAI will call for bids from other parties for the procurement within a fixed timeline. Those bidders who will be able to match the technical part with lower financial bids will be called along with the startup (with original proposal) to go for second round of bidding. The bidder with the lowest bid, after the second round of bidding, will be selected. This process will be time bound and will be closed within a month of receiving the initial proposal.

 Frequently Asked Questions
 
 

 Find answers here to common questions about the public procurement process.
 










* [General](#45263974406267317-0)

















 
 1 
 
[Q. How can I find out about government tender opportunities?](#1624444332759)

It is mandatory for all Ministries/ Departments of the Central Government, their attached and Subordinate Offices and Autonomous/Statutory Bodies to publish their tender enquiries, corrigenda thereon and details of bid awards on the Central Portal for Public Procurement ([eprocure.gov.in](https://eprocure.gov.in/cppp/)). You may visit the website to get access to all the tenders across India.


 


It is also a good idea to visit Government e Marketplace ([gem.gov.in](http://gem.gov.in)) to view tenders.


 









 
 2 
 
[Q. What are various kinds of tenders?](#1624444642230)

The GFRs 2017 have defined 5 kinds of tenders as below:


 


**i.  Advertised Tender Enquiry**


Invitation to tenders by advertisement should be used for procurement of goods of estimated value of Rs. 25 lakhs and above. In such cases, the tender enquiry should be advertised on the Central Public Procurement Portal (CPPP) at www.eprocure.gov.in and on GeM. An organisation having its own website should also publish all its advertised tender enquiries on the website.



**ii.   Limited Tender Enquiry**


In a limited tender enquiry, various vendors (more than three) are empaneled by the Government Department for goods that are procured regularly by the Department. Usually Limited Tender Enquiry is adopted when the estimated value of the goods to be procured is less than INR 25 Lac.


 


**iii.   Two\-Stage Bidding**


For purchasing high\-value plant, machinery, etc. of a complex and technical nature, bids may consist of two parts, as below:


a. Technical bid consisting of all technical details along with commercial terms and conditions; and


b. Financial bid indicating item\-wise price for the items mentioned in the technical bid.


 


**iv.   Single Tender Enquiry**


Procurement from a single source may be resorted to in the following circumstances:


a. When only a particular firm is a manufacturer of the required goods, to the best of the concerned government department's knowledge.


b. In case of an emergency, when it is necessary to purchase the required goods from a particular source. In such cases, the reason for such a decision must be recorded, and approval of competent authority must be obtained.


c. When specific standardised machines or spare parts have to be acquired in order to be compatible with existing sets of equipment (on the advice of a competent technical expert and approved by the relevant authority).


 


**v.   Electronic Reverse Auctions**


An Electronic Reverse Auction is a type of online auction in which the traditional roles of buyer and seller in an auction are reversed. In an ordinary auction, buyers compete to obtain goods or services by offering increasingly higher prices. Conversely, in an electronic reverse auction, there is one buyer and many potential sellers. The sellers compete to obtain business from the buyer, and prices will typically decrease as the sellers underbid each other.









 
 3 
 
[Q. What is pre\-qualification criteria?](#1559545575202)

The pre\-qualification criteria is the eligibility criteria which enables the Bidder to participate in techno\-commercial evaluation. Pre\-qualification criteria is generally relevant only for two\-bid tender enquiries involving Quality\-cum\-Cost Based Selection.









 
 4

Prospective bidders are permitted to request clarifications on the invitation for bids or request for proposals by a stipulated date, and the pre\-bid meeting is held within that period.


 









 
 5 
 
[Q. What is a technical proposal and financial proposal?](#1559545642672)

A technical bid or proposal is a submission by the Bidder containing the technical aspects of the goods and services offered. This submission must satisfy the pre\-qualification and technical evaluation criteria.


A financial bid or proposal is a submission by the Bidder that includes a breakdown of pricing for the items or services proposed in the Technical Bid. Usually, the financial bid is only opened for those bidders whose technical bids qualify or meet the desired criteria.









 
 6 
 
[Q. How are the bids evaluated?](#1559545668718)

Submitted tenders are evaluated against the awarding criteria described in the tender documentation (e.g. price, methodology, time of delivery). Commonly utilised processes are – Least Cost, Quality\-cum\-Cost Based Selection, and Quality Based Selection. 









 
 7 
 
[Q. Which Departments should be contacted for public procurement queries?](#1624444884902)

Each Government Department has a finance/procurement \& sales wing that conducts the procurement activities for the entire department. This wing may have a varying purpose in Central vs State departments, but usually they should be the point of contact for procurement related queries. You can usually find the contact information for the relevant office on the Contact Us page of that Government Department's website.
