States' Startup Ecosystem Ranking
---------------------------------


The States' Startup Ranking is a yearly capacity building exercise created and released by DPIIT that
 evaluates all of India's states and Union Territories on their efforts to build an ecosystem conducive to startup
 growth.  
  

 States' Startup Ranking was launched in February 2018 to achieve the vision of building a robust startup
 ecosystem in the country. It aims to evaluate the Indian startup landscape through the eyes of state policy
 intervention and identify state practices that accelerate ecosystem growth and development.  
  
 The states
 ranking has led each state to have dedicated startup policies and through annual rankings, it tracks the
 evolution of these policies and the overall efforts of states in ecosystem building.

What We Do

Since its inception, the Startup India Initiative has contributed to building a robust
 startup ecosystem in
 India by nurturing innovation, catalyzed networking, designing policy measures, and mentoring.
   
  
The

 enliven the entrepreneurial mindset across the length and breadth of the country. Capacity Building
 Measures have been undertaken by the Team across States and Union Territories for ecosystem enablers
