Similarly, banks provide loans only to asset\\-backed applicants. It is essential to provide seed funding to startups with an innovative idea to conduct proof of concept trials.\n\nDPIIT has created Startup India Seed Fund Scheme (SISFS) with an outlay of INR 945 Crore to provide financial assistance to startups for Proof of Concept, prototype development, product trials, market entry, and commercialization.It will support an estimated 3,600 entrepreneurs through 300 incubators in the next 4 years.",
